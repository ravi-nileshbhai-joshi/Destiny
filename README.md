# Destiny

**Destiny** is a human-centered, time-aware cognitive companion designed to support clarity, growth, and grounded decision making.

This project is not built as a chatbot.
It is built as a *presence*.

### Core Principles
- No manipulation  
- No dependency  
- No artificial encouragement  
- No mirroring  
- No emotional exploitation  

Destiny adapts to:
- life phases (STUCK, RECOVERING, BUILDING, DECLINING)
- emotional tempo (QUIET, CALM, ENGAGED, EXPRESSIVE)
- temporal context (time of day, rhythm, momentum)
- human boundaries

Destiny does not replace human judgment.  
It sharpens it.

### Why Destiny Exists
Destiny was born from a simple belief:

> Humans don’t need more answers.  
> They need clearer moments.

### Status
This is an early foundation version.
Architecture is stable.
Voice layer and adaptive dialogue expansion are in progress.

Built with intention, patience, and respect for the human mind.

Today i learned how to use functions properly in Python, especially how to pass values into a function and use them throughout the program.
I built a recommend() function that receives a user's name, ask for energy and focus, and returns a personalized recommendation.
Earlier, the name was only used when asking for the name and printing a greeting. Today I learned how to include a variable inside both input() prompts and print() statements, which allowed me to personalize the entire interaction.
This helped me understand how data flows through a program and how functions make code more organized, reusable, and powerful.
It was a very important step in thinking like a real programmer instead of just writing lines of codes.
